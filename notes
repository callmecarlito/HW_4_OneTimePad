keygen
- key should be same size or longer than message being encrypted
- each bit/char of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding char bit/char from the pad using modular addition

otp_enc_d / otp_dec_d
- should handle SIGTERM signal and clean up child processes and close sockets
  - maybe do SIGINT also
- memset buffer containing encrypted string ??
- if error occurs during send/recv
  - print error to stderr and close connection to client only

pseudocode after connection is accepted b/w otp_enc_d and otp_enc

  verify id
    recv message from otp_enc
      if messsage confirms otp_enc 
        send success message to otp_enc
      else handle errors

  otp_enc sends size of plaintext file
  otp_end_d confirms size with message
  otp_enc sends plaintext file
  otp_enc_d recv's until num_bytes == sz_plaintext
  otp_enc_d sends success message   

  otp_enc sends size of key file
  otp_end_d confirms size with message
  otp_enc sends key file
  otp_enc_d recv's until num_bytes == sz_key
  otp_enc_d sends success message ??

  otp_enc_d encrypts plaintext
    -recv plaintext and key into files??? or two buffers???
    
  otp_enc_d sends size of ciphertext
  otp_enc confirms size with message
  otp_enc_d sends ciphertext
  otp_enc recv's until num_bytes == sz_ciphertext
    then print out ciphertext
    send success message to otp_enc_d
    close connection
  otp_enc_d close connection

programs rejecting eachother
- send string that id's itself
  - if not correct string, close connection
