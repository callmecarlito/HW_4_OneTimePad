# cs344-one_time_pad
1/18/21 - I decided to recreate this program using python as I've become curious about learning the language more. This orgininally began as a project that was assigned in my Operating Systems class. It was meant to incorporate the topics of multiprocessing and socket-based inter-process communication. The project was originally written in C. 

Again, this program (or set of programs) aims to handle encryption and decryption of information using a one-time pad system.
